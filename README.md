## Overview

Welcome to the YouTube Dummy Project repository! This project is a result of following the "HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro" by [SuperSimpleDev](https://supersimple.dev/courses/html-css-course). The goal of this project was to gain a comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS by creating a simplified version of the YouTube interface.

**Technologies Used:**
HTML5/CSS3


### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It provides a set of elements (tags) that define the content of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. In this project, HTML was utilized to structure the various components of the YouTube interface, including video containers, navigation bars, and footer sections.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is a style sheet language that controls the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to style and customize the appearance of web pages, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive design. Throughout this project, CSS was employed to apply styles, define layouts, and enhance the overall look of the YouTube dummy interface.
